# InsuranceProgramProject
The program is to calculate car insurance premium based on age and another exception which included number of accidents. 
The testing involved in refactored code in Junit (test suit). I was required to use annotations,
@BeforeAll, at BeforeEach, @Test, @ParameterixedTest, @timeout, @AferAll and @AfterEach.
